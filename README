This is the first version of vontact manager program.
Which includes two modules.
1) cb.py contains a class which is the basis of this program.
2) cm.py this is the starting point.

Coding is started after reading the tutorial of Swaroop.C.H's "A Byte of Python"
He stated in that book, ie., if you able to write such a program, then you can 
clain that you are a python programmer.
So Now I am a PYTHON CODER.
